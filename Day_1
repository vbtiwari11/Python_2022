As you've seen, ndigits=-1 rounds to the nearest 10, ndigits=-2 rounds to the nearest 100 and so on. Where might this be useful? Suppose we're dealing with large numbers:

The area of Finland is 338,424 km²
The area of Greenland is 2,166,086 km²

We probably don't care whether it's really 338,424, or 338,425, or 338,177. All those digits of accuracy are just distracting. We can chop them off by calling round() with ndigits=-3:

The area of Finland is 338,000 km²
The area of Greenland is 2,166,000 km²
